Things TO DO in JARVIS when you are 0xDEAD
------------------------------------------

[done] Use a QSplitter within the layout in order to be able to resize! :)
[done] Refactor the whole damn thing creating a "parent widget". Most widgets are very similar, I don't want to have to duplicate all changes to a QTable :)
[fixed] Unicode strings bug!
[done] Runtime options have an effect
[done] Implement XOR of a selection?
[done] Save scratchpad notes to file
[done] Options -> Strings, Comments -> show unique hits (default: False)
[done] Ability to order columns in tables
[done] Add a QtGui.QColorDialog to select the PIN trace color at import time :)
    See zetcode.com/gui/pysidetutorial/dialogs
[done] Connection graph
[done] Change from buttons to a nice toolbar :)
[done] GUI for Connection graph :)
[done] Get functions calling input (network, file, etc.)
[done] Add icons to the CustomWidget table QMenu
[don't implement] Save JARVIS state (json serialize to file)
[done] Export current function for tools like miasm (binary ascii hex encoded)
[don't implement] Implement export function (or selection) as ASM? To be able to inline it in C
    This is done in IDA via Produce File -> MAP (or LST, I don't remember)
[fixed] Option to see unique calls (calls missed, a lot!)
[done] Search suspicious filenames too (inlined memcpy detected by IDA, etc.)
[done] Import PIN information regarding dynamic call resolution
[done] Add better exception traceback (traceback.format_exc())
[done] Option to reflect the patched bytes (in the IDA database) to the binary file
[done] Show immediate compares (Binary Analysis) display them in a table as well
[done] Option to tighten the search for dangerous functions
[fixed] "Show all functions" scrolls to the current one
[done] Automatically find paths between "input" and "dangerous" functions
[done] http://icons8.com (10k or more indexed icons)


[] Format string detection
[] Multibyte string (byte chars + multibyte) vs. Wide string (all chars have the same length)
[] Analyze LoadLibrary / GetProcAddress information
[] Connect graph for blocks within current function
[] Export comments, names, etc. in JSON format. Useful to change between IDA versions!
    This can be done via "export to idc file" but it always crashes importing :/
    The idea is to have something more... lightweight

[] Find functions similar to the current one
